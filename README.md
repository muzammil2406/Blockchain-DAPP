# Blockchain-Based Secure Transaction System
This project leverages blockchain technology to enhance transaction security and transparency. It ensures tamper-proof data storage using a decentralized ledger, reducing the risk of fraud and unauthorized modifications. Built with Ethereum and Solidity, the system enables secure, verifiable, and immutable transactions.

# Key Features:
- Smart Contracts: Automates and secures transactions using Solidity.
- Decentralization: Eliminates central authority, ensuring transparency.
- Cryptographic Security: Uses hashing algorithms to prevent data tampering.
- Immutable Ledger: Ensures transaction history remains unchanged.
- Web3 Integration: Allows seamless interaction with the blockchain network.
  
This project demonstrates my ability to develop secure, decentralized applications (DApps) and integrate blockchain-based solutions into real-world use cases.
